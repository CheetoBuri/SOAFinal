# 1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to App passwords: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 4. Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or your device)
# 5. Copy the generated 16-character password
# 6. Fill in below:

GMAIL_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
